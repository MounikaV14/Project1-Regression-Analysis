`'Motivation'`
  Eventhough there are so many datasets that use complex algorithms to solve the real world problems, Regression is one of the classical approach to undertand a prediction problem. Here in this study we predict the price of houses using Melbourne dataset.

`'Dataset'`
The Melbourne Dataset used for the analysis can be found in this respository with a file named Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv

`'About the project'`

*****Libraries used in the project ******
1. Numpy: NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
2. Pandas: Python library used for data manipulation and anlysis
3. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
4. Seaborn: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
5. Scikit learn:  Built based on Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. This is used for predictive analysis and many other classification algorithms
